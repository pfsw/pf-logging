	<H1>Logging API</H1>
	<BR>
	Contains an independent logging interface that allows to do logging inside
	the PF components without the dependency on a specific logging component
	such as log4j or jlog.
	<p>
	It provides a mechanism to bind the actual logging to an external logging framework.
	Therefore an adapter implementation is needed.
